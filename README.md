SAP HANA Cloud Samples - Responsive UI
========


[CD208sups](https://cd208.netweaver.ondemand.com/) is a responsive web application for showcasing the power of open source and [SAP HANA Cloud](http://scn.sap.com/community/developer-center/cloud-platform). It hosts the supplements of SAPs TechEd 2012 session [Tapping into Open Source with SAP HANA Cloud](http://www2.sapevents.com/SAP/TechEd2012/index.cfm?fuseaction=agenda.sessioncataloguehos&sid=9600_23967) and serves as a central entry point to the content. In addition, the application integrates a simple Twitter dashboard.

The frontend part, hosted in this repository, leverages the following open source frameworks:
* [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/)
* [Backbone.JS](http://backbonejs.org/)
* [Underscore.JS](http://underscorejs.org/)
* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)
* [json2](https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js)
* [Jasmine.JS](https://jasmine.github.io/)
* [Sinon.JS](http://sinonjs.org/)

Several icons from [Glyphicons Free](http://glyphicons.com/), licensed under CC BY 3.0, are used. In addition, the frontend relies on three icons from [The Noun Project](http://thenounproject.com/): The ["home"](http://thenounproject.com/noun/home/#icon-No293) symbol by the noun project itself (licensed under CC BY 3), the ["book"](http://thenounproject.com/noun/book/#icon-No2248) symbol by Foomandoonian (licensed under CC0), and the ["information"](https://cd208.netweaver.ondemand.com/_http://thenounproject.com/noun/book/#icon-No2249) symbol by Sven Hofmann (licensed under CC BY 3), from [The Noun Project collection](http://thenounproject.com/).

Versioning
----------

For transparency and insight into our release cycle, and for striving to maintain backward compatibility, the SAP HANA Cloud - Samples project will be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible.

Releases will be numbered with the following format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor and patch)
* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor (and resets the patch)
* Bug fixes and misc changes bumps the patch
